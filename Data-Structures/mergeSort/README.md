# Challenge Summary
Lecture notes for teaching the Merged Sort Algorithm.

## Challenge Description
Merge Sort takes advantage of a divide and conquer. It takes an array and divides it in half and continues until there is only one item. It then fuses them together into a sorted array. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the recurrence method which has an O(n) time space.
