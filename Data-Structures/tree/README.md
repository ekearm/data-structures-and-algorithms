#Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree

This data structure is about trees. 
A tree is not only a plant but can be used to model data in a binary tree a root node is connected to at least on other node.
 The real power of a tree though is in BST where your O(n) becomes O(log) cutting down your search algorithim.

 In breadth search which uses a binary tree it reads the layers of the tree left to right
